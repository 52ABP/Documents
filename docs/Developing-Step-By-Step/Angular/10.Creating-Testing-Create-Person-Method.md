# Testing CreatePerson Method

You can skip this section if you don't interest in **automated
testing**.

We can create a unit test method to test CreatePerson method as shown
below:

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task Should_Create_Person_With_Valid_Arguments()
{
    //Act
    await _personAppService.CreatePerson(
        new CreatePersonInput
        {
            Name = "John",
            Surname = "Nash",
            EmailAddress = "john.nash@abeautifulmind.com"
        });

    //Assert
    UsingDbContext(
        context =>
        {
            var john = context.Persons.FirstOrDefault(p => p.EmailAddress == "john.nash@abeautifulmind.com");
            john.ShouldNotBe(null);
            john.Name.ShouldBe("John");
        });
}
```

Test method also written using **async/await** pattern since calling
method is async. We called CreatePerson method, then checked if given
person is in the database. **UsingDbContext** method is a helper method
of **AppTestBase** class (which we inherited this unit test class from).
It's used to easily get a reference to DbContext and use it directly to
perform database operations.

This method successfully works since all required fields are supplied.
Let's try to create a test for **invalid arguments**:

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task Should_Not_Create_Person_With_Invalid_Arguments()
{
    //Act and Assert
    await Assert.ThrowsAsync<AbpValidationException>(
        async () =>
                {
                    await _personAppService.CreatePerson(
                        new CreatePersonInput
                        {
                            Name = "John"
                        });
                });
}
```

We did not set **Surname** property of CreatePersonInput despite it being
**required**. So, it throws **AbpValidationException** automatically.
Also, we can not send null to CreatePerson method since validation
system also checks it. This test calls CreatePerson with invalid
arguments and asserts that it throws AbpValidationException. See
