# ABP框架中为Person应用服务创建单元测试

如果您对自动化测试不感兴趣，则可以跳过此部分。

通过编写**单元测试**，我们可以测试`PersonAppService.GetPeople`方法而无需创建用户界面。

我们在解决方案的`.Tests`项目中编写单元测试。

## 单元测试中的多租户

由于我们禁用了多租户，因此我们也应该将其禁用以用于单元测试
在YoyoSoft.PhoneBookDemo.Core项目中打开PhoneBookDemoConsts类，并将“ MultiTenancyEnabled”设置为false

重建并运行单元测试后，您将看到跳过了一些测试（这些测试与多租户相关）。

让我们创建第一个测试来验证没有任何筛选条件的人：


```csharp

namespace YoyoSoft.PhoneBookDemo.Tests.People
{
    public class PersonAppService_Tests
    {
        private readonly IPersonApplicationService _personAppService;

        public PersonAppService_Tests()
        {
            _personAppService = IocManager.Instance.Resolve<IPersonApplicationService>();
        }

        [Fact]
        public void Should_Get_All_People_Without_Any_Filter()
        {
            //执行方法
            var persons = _personAppService.GetPeople(new GetPeopleInput());

            //断言
            persons.Items.Count.ShouldBe(2);
        }
    }
}

```
  

We derived test class from **AppTestBase**. AppTestBase class
initializes all system, creates an in-memory fake database, seeds
initial data (that we created before) to database and logins to
application as admin. So, this is actually an **integration test** since
it tests all server-side code from entity framework mapping to
application services, validation and authorization.

In constructor, we get (resolve) an **IPersonAppService** from
**dependency injection** container. It creates the **PersonAppService**
class with all dependencies. Then we can use it in test methods.

Since we're using [xUnit](http://xunit.github.io/), we add **Fact**
attribute to each test method. In the test method, we called
**GetPeople** method and checked if there are **two people** in the
returned list as we know that there were 2 people in **initial**
database.

Let's run the **all unit tests** in Test Explorer and see if it works:

<img src="images/phone-book-unit-test-success-2.png" alt="xUnit unit test success" class="img-thumbnail" />

As you see, it worked **successfully**. Now, we know that
PersonAppService works properly without any filter. Let's add a new unit
test to get filtered people:

```csharp
[Fact]
public void Should_Get_People_With_Filter()
{
    //Act
    var persons = _personAppService.GetPeople(
        new GetPeopleInput
        {
            Filter = "adams"
        });

    //Assert
    persons.Items.Count.ShouldBe(1);
    persons.Items[0].Name.ShouldBe("Douglas");
    persons.Items[0].Surname.ShouldBe("Adams");
}
```

Again, since we know initial database, we can check returned results
easily. Here, initial test data is important. When we change initial
data, our test may fail even if our services are correct. So, it's
better to write unit tests independent of initial data as much as
possible. We could check incoming data to see if every people contains
"adams" in his/her name, surname or email. Thus, if we add new people to
initial data, our tests remain working.

There are many techniques on unit testing, I kept it simple here. But
ASP.NET Zero template makes very easy to write unit and integration
tests by base classes and pre-build test codes.
