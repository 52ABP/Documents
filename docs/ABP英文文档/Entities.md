Entities are one of the core concepts of DDD (Domain Driven Design).
Eric Evans describe it as "*An object that is not fundamentally defined
by its attributes, but rather by a thread of continuity and identity*".

Essentially, entities have Id's and are stored in a database. An entity is generally
mapped to a table in a relational database.

### Entity Class

In ASP.NET Boilerplate, Entities are derived from the **Entity** class. See
the example below:

    public class Person : Entity
    {
        public virtual string Name { get; set; }
    
        public virtual DateTime CreationTime { get; set; }
    
        public Person()
        {
            CreationTime = DateTime.Now;
        }
    }

The **Person** class is defined as an entity. It has two properties as well as the
**Id** property defined in the Entity base class. The **Id** is the **primary key** of the
Entity. The name of the primary keys for all Entities are the same, it is **Id**.

The type of the Id (primary key) can be changed. It is **int** (Int32) by
default. If you want to define another type as Id, you should explicitly
declare it as shown below:

    public class Person : Entity<long>
    {
        public virtual string Name { get; set; }
    
        public virtual DateTime CreationTime { get; set; }
    
        public Person()
        {
            CreationTime = DateTime.Now;
        }
    }

You can set it as string, Guid or something else.

Entity class overrides the **equality** operator (==) to easily check if two
entities are equal (their Id is equal). It also defines the
**IsTransient()** method to check if it has an Id or not.

### AggregateRoot Class

"*Aggregate is a pattern in Domain-Driven Design. A DDD aggregate is a
cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit. An
example may be an order and its line-items, these will be separate
objects, but it's useful to treat the order (together with its line
items) as a single aggregate.*" (Martin Fowler - see the [full
description](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DDD_Aggregate.html))

While ABP does not enforce you to use aggregates, you may want to create
aggregates and aggregate roots in your application. ABP defines
the **AggregateRoot** class that extends an Entity to create aggregate root
entities for an aggregate.

#### Domain Events

AggregateRoot defines the [**DomainEvents**](EventBus-Domain-Events.md)
collection to generate domain events by the aggregate root class. These
events are automatically triggered just before the current [unit of
work](Unit-Of-Work.md) is completed. In fact, any entity can generate
domain events by implementing the **IGeneratesDomainEvents** interface, but
it's common (a best practice) to generate domain events in aggregate
roots. That's why it's the default for the AggregateRoot but not for the Entity
class.

### Conventional Interfaces

In many applications, similar entity properties (and database table
fields) are used, like CreationTime, which indicates when an entity was
created. ASP.NET Boilerplate provides some useful interfaces to make
these common properties explicit and expressive. This provides a
way of coding common code for Entities which implement these interfaces.

#### Auditing

**IHasCreationTime** makes it possible to use a common property for the
'**creation time**' information of an entity. When this interface is implemented,
ASP.NET Boilerplate automatically sets the CreationTime to the **current time** when 
an Entity is inserted into the database.

    public interface IHasCreationTime
    {
        DateTime CreationTime { get; set; }
    }

The Person class can be re-written as shown below by implementing the
IHasCreationTime interface:

    public class Person : Entity<long>, IHasCreationTime
    {
        public virtual string Name { get; set; }
    
        public virtual DateTime CreationTime { get; set; }
    
        public Person()
        {
            CreationTime = DateTime.Now;
        }
    }

**ICreationAudited** extends IHasCreationTime by addingÂ 
**CreatorUserId**:

    public interface ICreationAudited : IHasCreationTime
    {
        long? CreatorUserId { get; set; }
    }

ASP.NET Boilerplate automatically sets the CreatorUserId property
to the **current user's id** when saving a new entity. You can also 
easily implement ICreationAudited by deriving your entity from the 
**CreationAuditedEntity** class. It also has a generic version for 
different types of Id properties.

There are also similar interfaces for modifications:

    public interface IHasModificationTime
    {
        DateTime? LastModificationTime { get; set; }
    }
    
    public interface IModificationAudited : IHasModificationTime
    {
        long? LastModifierUserId { get; set; }
    }

ASP.NET Boilerplate automatically sets these properties when
updating an entity. You just have to define them for your entity.

If you want to implement all of the audit properties, you can directly
implement the **IAudited** interface:

    public interface IAudited : ICreationAudited, IModificationAudited
    {
    
    }

As a shortcut, you can derive from the **AuditedEntity** class instead of
directly implementing **IAudited**. The AuditedEntity class also has a
generic version for different types of Id properties.

Note: ASP.NET Boilerplate gets the current user's Id from [ABP
Session](/Pages/Documents/Abp-Session).

#### Soft Delete

Soft delete is a commonly used pattern to mark an Entity as deleted
instead of actually deleting it from database. For instance, you may not
want to hard delete a User from the database since it has many relations to
other tables. The **ISoftDelete** interface is used for this purpose:

    public interface ISoftDelete
    {
        bool IsDeleted { get; set; }
    }

ASP.NET Boilerplate implements the soft delete pattern out-of-the-box. When
a soft-delete entity is being deleted, ASP.NET Boilerplate detects this,
prevents deleting, sets IsDeleted as true, and then updates the entity in the
database. It also does not retrieve (select) soft deleted entities from
the database by automatically filtering them.

If you use soft delete, you may also want to store information of when an
entity was deleted and who deleted it. You can implement the
**IDeletionAudited** interface, shown below:

    public interface IDeletionAudited : ISoftDelete
    {
        long? DeleterUserId { get; set; }
    
        DateTime? DeletionTime { get; set; }
    }


As you've probably noticed, IDeletionAudited extends ISoftDelete. ASP.NET Boilerplate
automatically sets these properties when an entity is deleted.

If you want to implement all the audit interfaces (creation, modification
and deletion) for an entity, you can directly implement **IFullAudited**
since it inherits from the others:

    public interface IFullAudited : IAudited, IDeletionAudited
    {
    
    }

As a shortcut, you can derive your entity from the **FullAuditedEntity**
class that implements them all.

-   NOTE 1: All audit interfaces and classes have a generic version for
    defining the navigation property to your **User** entity (like
    ICreationAudited&lt;TUser&gt; and FullAuditedEntity&lt;TPrimaryKey,
    TUser&gt;).
-   NOTE 2: All of them also have an **AggregateRoot** version, like
    AuditedAggregateRoot.

#### Active/Passive Entities

Some entities need to be marked as Active or Passive. You may take an
action upon the active/passive states of the entity. You can implement the
**IPassivable** interface that has been created for this reason. It defines
the **IsActive** property.

If your entity will be active on it's first creation, you can set IsActive to
true in the constructor.

This is different than soft delete (IsDeleted). If an entity is soft
deleted, it can not be retrieved from the database (ABP prevents it by
default). For active/passive entities, it's completely up to you 
on how you control the retrieval of these entities.

### Entity Change Events

ASP.NET Boilerplate automatically triggers certain events when an entity
is inserted, updated or deleted. You can register to these events
and perform any logic you need. See the Predefined Events section in the [event
bus documentation](/Pages/Documents/EventBus-Domain-Events) for more
information.

### IEntity Interfaces

The **Entity** class implements the **IEntity** interface (and
**Entity&lt;TPrimaryKey&gt;** implements
**IEntity&lt;TPrimaryKey&gt;**). If you do not want to derive from
the Entity class, you can implement these interfaces directly. There are
also corresponding interfaces for other entity classes. We don't recommend
you do this unless you have a good reason not to derive from the
Entity classes.

### Multi-Lingual Entities

ASP.NET Boilerplate provides a simple way for defining and using Multi-Lingual entities. For more information see [Multi-Lingual Entities](Multi-Lingual-Entities.md).

### IExtendableObject Interface

ASP.NET Boilerplate provides a simple interface, **IExtendableObject**,
to easily associate **arbitrary name-value data** to an entity. Consider
this simple entity:

    public class Person : Entity, IExtendableObject
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
    
        public string ExtensionData { get; set; }
    
        public Person(string name)
        {
            Name = name;
        }
    }

**IExtendableObject** defines the **ExtensionData** string property
which is used to store **JSON formatted** name value objects. Example:

    var person = new Person("John");
    
    person.SetData("RandomValue", RandomHelper.GetRandom(1, 1000));
    person.SetData("CustomData", new MyCustomObject { Value1 = 42, Value2 = "forty-two" });

We can use any type of object as a value to the **SetData** method. When we
use the code above, **ExtensionData** will look like this:

    {"CustomData":{"Value1":42,"Value2":"forty-two"},"RandomValue":178}

We can then use **GetData** to get the values:

    var randomValue = person.GetData<int>("RandomValue");
    var customData = person.GetData<MyCustomObject>("CustomData");

While this technique can be very useful in some cases (when you need to
provide the ability to dynamically add extra data to an entity), you
should normally use regular properties. Such dynamic usage is not type
safe and explicit.
